## About Me

Sefa Osmanoğlu, a 2023 nursing graduate from Halic University, developed an interest in technology during their studies by taking lessons in machine learning math. This sparked a passion for software development, leading Sefa to explore web3 technologies. They joined the "RiseIn" developer group, where they found a supportive community. Through RiseIn, Sefa participated in the Stellar Fullstack Bootcamp, further advancing their skills in blockchain development. Outside of work, Sefa enjoys socializing and playing games, balancing their love for technology with a strong social life.

## Description

Transafety is a Stellar blockchain-based platform designed to facilitate secure money transfers and trades. The platform allows two parties to exchange goods or services while ensuring the safe transfer of funds. Each transaction includes a messaging feature, enabling users to communicate important details or terms of the trade directly within the system. This secure messaging ensures transparency and trust between both parties during the transaction. Built on the Stellar network, Transafety leverages fast and cost-effective payments, making it an efficient solution for individuals or businesses looking for a simple yet secure way to trade and transfer money.

## Vision

Transafety envisions a future where trading and transferring money is simple, secure, and transparent for everyone. By providing a platform that integrates both safe payments and clear communication, we aim to make transactions more trustworthy and efficient. Transafety empowers individuals and businesses to trade with confidence, knowing their funds are protected and their messages are clear. With our solution, we believe we can reshape how people conduct business, making the process faster, more detailed, and safer. Our goal is to create a global impact, fostering trust in every transaction across borders.
